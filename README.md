## Tensorflow.js implementation for Hindi Handwritten Characters Recognition Repo

***main.js*** contains all of the tensorflow.js code written in JavaScript.

**Only these characters are trained for now (Hindi Characters):**
0, ka, kha, sa, Ta, Dna, ga, gha, ma, cha
To view dataset see my [Hindi Handwritten Characters Recognition using Keras and Tensorflow](https://github.com/satishp962/hindi_handwritten_characters_recognition) repo.

The trained model of this repo is converted into Tensorflow.js format using the TFJS converter. The folder model contains the converted files.
